# Dance Giphtastic!
A one-page app I built during my time in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp that takes in search terms, uses those terms to search giphy.com and displays related giphs.  I built it with JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap and the giphy.com API. In the bootcamp, we were given a minimal description of what our app should do and expected to figure it out.  

See it here: 

## Preview ballet dancing giphs!

* Select from the given series of ballet topics and you will see ballet dancing giphs. 
* You will see 10 giphs at a time, and they are refreshed with each new selection.    
* You can individually click on the giphs to play them and then click on them again to stop them.  
* You can also type any search topic into the text box and you will see related giphs. 
* When you type-in a new search topic, a button is created for you that adds it to your collection of topics.   
* You can add as many new topics as you like!
